### Intro

Hi, my name is Slava, I'm a software engineer with a knack for diving into backend infrastructure and services. I love learning, debugging, and building. My motto is: 
> "There’s nothing that you can not learn that can not be learned. There is nothing you can not do that can not be done."

At [@Nextdoor](https://github.com/Nextdoor) I work on the Core Services team on distributed systems and scalability problems.

I'm passionate about 🐝 bee keeping, 🏎️ Formula 1, and ☕ third wave coffee.
